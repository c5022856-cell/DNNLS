Modeling Results Summary

Text-only Baseline:
A GPT-2 text-only baseline was trained for 1 epoch.
- Training loss: 2.2318
- Validation loss: 2.0305

This baseline demonstrates fluent text generation but does not incorporate any visual information, often resulting in generic or visually ungrounded captions.

Project4 (Multimodal Alignment Model):
The proposed model combines CLIP-based image and text embeddings with a shared encoder and a prefix-conditioned GPT-2 decoder.
The model was trained for 2 epochs using a multi-loss objective consisting of text loss, image embedding regression loss, and image–text alignment loss.

Project4 v2 (Refined Alignment Model):
To address alignment collapse observed in Project4, the alignment loss was modified to use frozen CLIP text embeddings of the ground-truth caption.
This refinement results in more stable and realistic alignment behaviour during training.
